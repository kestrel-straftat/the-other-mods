## Config

Once you hit the ground the mod automatically corrects your rotation to the original limits, or to looking straight forward
if you were in the air for long enough. You can configure the amount of time in the air after which you'll be corrected
to looking forwards and the amount of time the correction takes (you can also disable this feature entirely). 

## Manual Installation Instructions

_**(you should probably just use a mod manager like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) though)**_

- Download and install [Bepinex 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) <br><small>(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0 and it might work. maybe)</small>
- Once BepInEx is installed, extract the zip into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.
