# Aboubi Unbound

This mod removes all invisible walls from the game (and optionally all killplanes too)

## Config

The host's config will be synced to all players in the lobby. The config allows you to enable/disable the mod entirely, as
well as enable/disable killplanes. Using [Mod Menu](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/kestrel/Mod_Menu/) is highly
recommended to change your config while in game!

### A note

The game does occasionally use invisible walls usefully, i.e. to make climbing stairs appear smoother. The mod tries its
hardest to ignore these edge cases, but might not catch them all! If you find a particularly gamebreaking one, annoy
me in the straftat discord (@sneaky_kestrel) until I fix it. Thanks!

## Manual Installation Instructions

_**(you should probably just use a mod manager like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) though)**_

- Download and install [Bepinex 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) <br><small>(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0 and it might work. maybe)</small>
- Once BepInEx is installed, extract the zip into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.
