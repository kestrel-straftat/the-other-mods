# RecentlyPlayed

Hey! You know how theres a list of players that you've recently played that you can copy in the stats screen. Steam also
has one of those which you can find in the overlay and the friends menu. This mod adds players you've played to steam's list,
which allows you to easily add them as friends or view their profiles.
